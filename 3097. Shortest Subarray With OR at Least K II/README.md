# Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K II

## Problem Description

You are given an array `nums` of **non-negative** integers and an integer `k`.

An array is called **special** if the bitwise `OR` of all of its elements is **at least* `k`.

Return *the length of the **shortest special non-empty** subarray of* `nums`, *or return* `-1` *if no special subarray exists*.



## Solution Approach

This solution uses a sliding window approach to find the shortest subarray that satisfies the required condition. We maintain a bit count array to keep track of the bitwise OR of the current window, adjusting it as we expand or shrink the window to meet the condition `OR >= k`.

## Code Explanation

### `minimumSubarrayLength` Function

1. **Initialization:**
   - If `k` is 0, we return 1 immediately since any non-empty subarray would satisfy `OR >= 0`.
   - Initialize pointers `l` and `mn` (for tracking window size), a `bits` vector to track bit occurrences for the bitwise OR, and `mn` to store the minimum subarray length.

2. **Iterate through `nums`:**
   - For each element in `nums`, update the `bits` array to reflect the presence of bits in the current window `[l, i]`.

3. **Calculate the OR of the Current Window:**
   - Based on `bits`, compute `x` as the bitwise OR of the current window.

4. **Shrink the Window from the Left:**
   - While `x` meets the condition `x >= k`, update `mn` to record the current minimum length and move `l` (the left boundary) to the right, adjusting `bits` and recalculating `x`.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If no valid subarray was found, return -1. Otherwise, return the recorded minimum length `mn`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot m)$, where `n` is the size of `nums` and `m` is the number of bits (32 for non-negative integers).
- **Space Complexity:** $O(m)$, where `m` is the size of `bits` (fixed at 32 for the bitwise calculations).
