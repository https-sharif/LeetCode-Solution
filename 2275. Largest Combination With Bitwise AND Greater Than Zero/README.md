# Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero

## Problem Description

The **bitwise AND** of an array `nums` is the bitwise AND of all integers in `nums`.

- For example, for `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, the bitwise AND is equal to `1 & 5 & 3 = 1`.
- Also, for `nums = [7]`, the bitwise AND is `7`.
  
You are given an array of positive integers `candidates`. Evaluate the **bitwise AND** of every **combination** of numbers of `candidates`. Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in each combination.

Return *the size of the **largest** combination of* `candidates` *with a bitwise AND greater than* `0`.

## Solution Approach

The code iterates through each number's binary representation, tracking the number of times each bit position has a `1` across all candidates. It then finds the bit position with the maximum count, indicating the largest combination where this bit is consistently set.

## Code Explanation

### `largestCombination` Function

1. **Loop Through Candidates:** Iterates through each candidate number.
2. **Bit Tracking:** For each bit position, checks if itâ€™s set (`1`) in the current candidate using `&` operation. If set, increments the count for that bit position in `mp`.
3. **Count Maximum Bit Frequency:** After counting `1`s in all bit positions across candidates, finds the highest frequency in `mp`, representing the largest possible combination of numbers sharing a common bit.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n \log(m))$, where `n` is the number of candidates, and `m` is the maximum integer value in the candidates.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(\log(m))$, for storing the frequency of set bits at each position.
