# LeetCode-Solution

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the daily LeetCode problems. Each solution is implemented in C++. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and share my solutions with others.

## LeetCode Profile

[![LeetCode](https://img.shields.io/badge/LeetCode-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=LeetCode&logoColor=#d16c06)](https://leetcode.com/u/sharif__islam/)

Check out my [LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/sharif__islam/) to see more of my coding solutions and progress!

## Structure

- Each folder is named after the problem and contains:
  - `solution.cpp`: The C++ code for the problem.
  - `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the solution.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharif-islam96403/leetcode-daily.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the problem folder:
   ```bash
   cd LeetCode-Solution/(problem-name)
   # Replace 'problem-name' with the actual problem name
   ```

3. Compile and run the solution:

   - **Using `g++` (GCC):**
     ```bash
     g++ solution.cpp -o solution
     ./solution
     ```

   - **Using `clang++` (Clang) or `Xcode` (macOS):**
     ```bash
     clang++ solution.cpp -o solution
     ./solution
     ```

   - **Using `MSVC` (Microsoft Visual Studio Compiler on Windows):**
     ```cmd
     cl solution.cpp
     solution.exe
     ```
