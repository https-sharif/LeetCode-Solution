# Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` where the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a **positive** number of balls.
  - For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.
    
Your penalty is the **maximum** number of balls in a bag. You want to **minimize** your penalty after the operations.

Return *the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations*.

## Solution Approach

The problem is solved using binary search to find the minimum possible maximum size of any bag after the operations. By evaluating the feasibility of a candidate size using a count of required operations, we determine the optimal size.

## Code Explanation

### `minimumSize` Function

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the search range `l` to `1` and `r` to the maximum value in `nums`.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Calculate the mid-point `mid` as the candidate maximum size.
   - For each bag, compute how many operations are needed to ensure the bag size is at most `mid` using `(nums[j] - 1) / mid`.
   - Sum these operations in `cnt`.

3. **Check Feasibility**:
   - If the total operations `cnt` is within `maxOperations`, reduce the search range by setting `r = mid`.
   - Otherwise, increase the search range with `l = mid + 1`.

4. **Termination**:
   - When the loop ends, `r` holds the minimum possible maximum size.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n \cdot \log(\text{max}(nums)))$, where $n$ is the size of `nums` and $\text{max}(nums)$ is the maximum element in `nums`. 
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
