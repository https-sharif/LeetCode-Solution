# Sentence Similarity III

## Problem Description

You are given two strings `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each representing a **sentence** composed of words. A sentence is a list of **words** that are separated by a **single** space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each word consists of only uppercase and lowercase English characters.

Two sentences `s1` and `s2` are considered **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. **Note** that the inserted sentence must be separated from existing words by spaces.

## Solution Approach

The approach involves splitting both sentences into individual words and checking if they can be aligned by comparing words at both ends. If matching words are found consecutively from the start or end of the sentences, then the sentences are considered similar.

## Code Explanation

### `areSentencesSimilar` Function

1. **Splitting sentences into words**:  
   The sentences are appended with an extra space to simplify splitting them into words. Two loops extract words from each sentence and store them in vectors `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Two-pointer comparison**:  
   Two pointers (`c1` and `c2`) start from the beginning, and two other pointers (`s1_size` and `s2_size`) start from the end of both vectors. The words are compared from both ends until a mismatch occurs or the pointers meet in the middle.

3. **Checking similarity**:  
   If either the front or back of both sentences aligns completely, the sentences are considered similar.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n + m)$, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `sentence1` and `sentence2`, respectively.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n + m)$, as additional space is required to store the split words of both sentences.
