# Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments

## Problem Description

You are given two **0-indexed** strings `str1` and `str2`.

In an operation, you select a set of indices in `str1`, and for each index `i` in the set, increment `str1[i]` to the next character **cyclically**. That is `'a'` becomes `'b'`, `'b'` becomes `'c'`, and so on, and `'z'` becomes `'a'`.

Return `true` *if it is possible to make* `str2` *a subsequence of* `str1` *by performing the operation **at most once**, and* `false` *otherwise*.

**Note**: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

## Solution Approach

The algorithm uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse through `str1` and `str2`, respectively. It checks if characters match directly or after transforming the character from `str1` to its next alphabet. The pointer `j` is incremented only when there is a valid match. If all characters in `str2` are matched, the function returns `true`; otherwise, `false`.

## Code Explanation

### `canMakeSubsequence` Function

- **Initialization**:  
  Start with `i = 0` (index for `str1`) and `j = 0` (index for `str2`), along with the sizes of the strings.

- **Traversal**:  
  - Iterate through `str1` using `i`.
  - If the character at `str2[j]` matches `str1[i]` directly or matches the next alphabet of `str1[i]` (using modular arithmetic for wrapping), increment `j`.
  - Increment `i` in every iteration.

- **Final Check**:  
  - If `j` equals the length of `str2`, all characters are matched; return `true`.
  - Otherwise, return `false`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, each character of `str1` is traversed once, where `n` is the length of `str1`.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, no additional space is used.
