# Can Construct K Palindromes

## Problem Description

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` *if you can use all the characters in* `s` *to construct* `k` *palindrome strings or* `false` *otherwise*.

## Solution Approach

The solution determines whether the string can be partitioned into `k` palindromes. A key observation is that each character with an odd frequency must be the center of a palindrome. The algorithm counts the characters with odd frequencies and checks if their count is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, it ensures that the total number of characters in the string is at least `k`, as fewer characters than `k` make constructing `k` palindromes impossible.

## Code Explanation

### `canConstruct` Function

- Count the frequency of each character in the string.
- Count the number of characters with odd frequencies.
- If the total number of characters is less than `k`, return `false`.
- If the number of characters with odd frequencies is less than or equal to `k`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The algorithm iterates through the string to count character frequencies and checks odd counts in a fixed array of size 26.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, as the frequency array has a fixed size of 26.
