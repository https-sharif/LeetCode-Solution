# Maximum XOR for Each Query

## Problem Description

You are given a **sorted** array `nums` of `n` non-negative integers and an integer `maximumBit`. You want to perform the following query `n` **times**:

- Find a non-negative integer `k < 2`<sup>`maximumBit`</sup> such that `nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[nums.length-1] XOR k` is **maximized**. `k` is the answer to the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> query.
- Remove the **last** element from the current array `nums`.
  
Return *an array* `answer`, *where* `answer[i]` *is the answer to the* `i`<sup>`th`</sup> *query*.

## Solution Approach

The code utilizes the XOR operation to efficiently calculate the maximum XOR for each query. By keeping track of cumulative XOR results, we use properties of XOR to determine the maximum possible value.

## Code Explanation

### `getMaximumXor` Function

1. **Initial Setup:**  
   Initialize `x` as the cumulative XOR of all elements in `nums`. Set `mx` as the maximum number representable within `maximumBit` bits.
   
2. **Iterate and Calculate Maximum XOR for Each Query:**  
   - For each element in `nums` (processed in reverse order), compute `ans[i]` as the XOR of `x` with `mx`, which provides the maximum possible XOR.
   - Update `x` by removing the influence of the current element (by XOR-ing `x` with the element).

3. **Return Result:**  
   The results are returned in reverse order.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, where `n` is the size of `nums`. 
- **Space Complexity:** $O(n)$, for storing the results in `ans`.
