# Valid Parentheses with Lock Mechanism

## Problem Description

A parentheses string is a **non-empty** string consisting only of `'('` and `')'`. It is valid if **any** of the following conditions is **true**:

- It is `()`.
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid parentheses strings.
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid parentheses string.

You are given a parentheses string `s` and a string `locked`, both of length `n`. `locked` is a binary string consisting only of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. For **each** index `i` of `locked`,

- If `locked[i]` is `'1'`, you **cannot** change `s[i]`.
- But if `locked[i]` is `'0'`, you **can** change `s[i]` to either `'('` or `')'`.

Return `true` *if you can make* `s` *a valid parentheses string*. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Solution Approach

The solution uses a single traversal with counters to verify if the string can be valid. It considers both locked and unlocked characters and ensures that the number of valid opening and closing parentheses aligns at the end.

## Code Explanation

### `canBeValid` Function

1. **Initial Checks**:  
   - If the string length is odd, return `false` immediately since it cannot form a valid set of parentheses.

2. **Traversal**:  
   - Use two counters: `open` and `close` to track the balance of parentheses as you iterate through the string.  
   - For each character, determine whether it's an open parenthesis `(` or a flexible (unlocked) character:
     - Adjust `open` and `close` based on these conditions.
   - If `close` becomes negative during traversal, it means the string cannot be balanced, so return `false`.

3. **Final Validation**:  
   - After the loop, ensure `open` is `0` to confirm the parentheses are balanced.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** $O(n)$, the solution traverses the string once, performing constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** $O(1)$, only a few integer variables are used for tracking counts, requiring constant space.
